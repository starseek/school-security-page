# BrickHouse Security: School Security Page
## Web page design for school secuirty services provided by BrickHouse Security

I work for BrickHouse Security, and this is one of my projects I am publishing here on GitHub. I want to showcase my ability to code as well as design. 

I designed this page in Adobe Photoshop and coded with HTML and CSS. The purpose of tis page is to generate new subscriptions and help promote BrickHouse Security B2B products and services. 

This page is targeted toward school security. Selling the concept of insalling security cameras, biometric locks, GPS Trackers for school security vehicles as well as custom solutions for unique security needs.
